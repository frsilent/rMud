I chose this subject in order to learn a large part of networking and language parsing.
I learned a good deal about templates as well since the author of the book I used to guide
me was really fond of them. I also used a good amount of #defines in order to make it
cross-compatable but later stripped most of the windows coding. My biggest issue with sockets
kept coming from how different Windows compilers would deal with sockets and how winsock would
define its own socket data type instead of just using an int for a handle. On the *nix side
I kept having issues with g++ version 4 being changed to no longer work with the templates I
was using. My planned solution is to add a link from the snapshot.debain repository to get an older
version of g++ and then defining that as the compiler in my makefile. I'm hoping this will resolve any
issues I was having from templates but this project is currently on hold.
